### 6. Learn Containers

[](https://github.com/milanm/DevOps-Roadmap?tab=readme-ov-file#6-learn-containers)

A **container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

**Docker** is by far the most popular container technology today. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

Here you need to know how to run containers, Docker Networking, Volumes, Dockerfiles, and run multiple containers with Docker-Compose.

Docker Compose is important as pre-requisite for Kubernetes. It is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

### 9. Learn CI/CD

[](https://github.com/milanm/DevOps-Roadmap?tab=readme-ov-file#9-learn-cicd)

Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing **automation** into the stages of app development. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams.

CI/CD introduces continuous automation and **continuous** monitoring throughout the lifecycle of apps, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment. These connected practices are often referred to as a "**CI/CD pipeline**" and are supported by development and operations teams.

There are **different stages** of a CI/CD pipeline, such as: **build, test and deploy**, but there could be much more activities included:

- Checking code from version control and building it
- Having staged gates for different kinds of approvals
- Managing environment variables
- Restarting services
- Executing tests
- And more...

Here you need to learn how to set up CI/CD server, integrate code and trigger pipelines automatically, store and read secrets, and build and package management tools.

Some **popular CI/CD tools** are: Jenkins, TeamCity, CircleCI, Bamboo, GitLab, and Azure DevOps.

### 11. Learn one Cloud provider

[](https://github.com/milanm/DevOps-Roadmap?tab=readme-ov-file#11-learn-one-cloud-provider)

Cloud providers provide a layer of APIs to abstract infrastructure and provision it based on security and billing boundaries. The cloud runs on servers in data centers, but the abstractions cleverly give the appearance of interacting with a single "platform" or large application. The ability to quickly provision, configure and secure resources with cloud providers has been key to both the tremendous success, and complexity, of modern DevOps.

The most popular cloud providers in the market are **AWS** and **Azure**, as well as **Google Cloud**.
